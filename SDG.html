Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) aims to achieve “zero hunger.”
<br>
 It is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015.
<br> 
 The official wording for SDG 2 is: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture

<li>Zero Hunger by 2030: The primary objective of SDG 2 is to create a world free of hunger by the year 2030.
<br>
 Unfortunately, the global issue of hunger and food insecurity has been on the rise since 2015.
<br> 
Factors such as the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities have exacerbated this trend.
<br>
As of 2022, approximately 735 million people (about 9.2% of the world’s population) suffer from chronic hunger,
a significant increase compared to 2019.
<br>
 Additionally, an estimated 2.4 billion people face moderate to severe food insecurity.</li>

<li>Challenges and Impact:
<ul>
<style>
ul
{
font-size: 30px; font-family:Serif;
}
</style>
<li>Malnutrition: Extreme hunger and malnutrition hinder sustainable development. 
<br>
 When people lack proper nourishment, they become less productive, more susceptible to diseases, and unable to improve their livelihoods.
</li>
<li>Stunting and Wasting: In 2022, 148 million children had stunted growth,
<br>
 and 45 million children under the age of 5 were affected by wasting due to inadequate nutrition.
</li>
<li>Projected Hunger: It is projected that more than 600 million people worldwide will face hunger by 2030,
<br>
 highlighting the immense challenge of achieving the zero hunger target.
</li>

<hr>
<li>Factors Contributing to Hunger:
<ul>
<style>
ul
{
font-size: 30px; font-family:Serif;
}
</style>
<li>Conflict: Armed conflicts disrupt food production and distribution, leading to scarcity.</li>
<li>Climate Shocks: Extreme weather events affect crop yields and food availability.</li>
<li>Rising Food Prices: Food prices remain high in many countries, impacting affordability.</li>
<li>Declining Food Production: Decreased agricultural productivity exacerbates food scarcity.</li>
<li>Investment in Agriculture: Critical for reducing hunger, poverty, and building resilience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<li>Why Should We Care?:
<ul>
<style>
ul
{
font-size: 30px; font-family:Serif;
}
</style>
<li>A world with zero hunger positively impacts economies, health, education, equality, and social development.</li>
<li>Hunger limits human development, hindering progress toward other sustainable development goals like education and gender equality. </li>
</ul>

<li>Achieving Zero Hunger:
<ul>
<style>
ul
{
font-size: 30px; font-family:Serif;
}
</style>
<li>Multi-Dimensional Approach: Achieving food security requires a multi-dimensional approach:
</ul>
<ul type="square">
<li>Social Protection: Ensuring access to food for vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>Sustainable Agriculture: Promoting practices that enhance food production while preserving the environment.</li>
<li> Transforming Food Systems: Creating a more inclusive and sustainable world. </li>
</ul>
